**Day 1**.

Monday was the first day of work expierence. I arrived early at around 8:55 AM, I had plenty of time before the day started at 10AM. I used this time to set my stuff down on my desk, looking around the office and chilling in the lounge area near the canteen. Once the day had started, we were all gathered into the bolger suite room and a few of us gave one fact about ourselves, after that was an agile talk. Agile is a collab effort with product owners, scrum masters and developers. After the talk was a one hour lunch break, but i was getting more sick so i had to go home.

* Introduction

**Day 2**.

Unfortunately I was not able to come into the office on this day. My sickness was holding me back, however when Jen did come home I was given a quick tutorial on Github and created my account and was given access to this blog.

**Day 3**.

I came back in today after my absent day from yesterday, i came in at about 9AM this morning and we had a stand up meeting, then we were seperated into 2 groups to make a rollercoaster that had to include a loop. My group lost and we did not complete it in time, we took our lunch and i played Rhys and Ben in pool, I beat the both of them at it. After the lunch break we went into another team building activity, one that you had to get a marshmellow at the highest point off the table. My group won that one twice.

* Rollercoaster team activity. 
* Winning two Pool matches.

**Day 5**.

Today is the last day of work expierence, it was a shorter day than the others. What we did on this day was sit through a talk on the history of Red Hat. The day only lasted about 3 hours so that was all we could do 
 

My closing line is that this work expierence was good, but it was also a shame I was sick for most of it.
